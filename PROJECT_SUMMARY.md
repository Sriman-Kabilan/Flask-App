## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema (SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM)

#### Product Table
- `product_id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `name` (VARCHAR 100, Required)
- `description` (TEXT, Optional)

#### Location Table
- `location_id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `name` (VARCHAR 100, Required)
- `address` (VARCHAR 200, Optional)

#### ProductMovement Table
- `movement_id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `timestamp` (DATETIME, Auto-set)
- `from_location` (Foreign Key, Nullable)
- `to_location` (Foreign Key, Nullable)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key, Required)
- `qty` (INTEGER, Required)

### 2. CRUD Operations

✅ **Products**
- List all products
- Add new product with validation
- Edit existing product
- Delete product (with constraint checking)

✅ **Locations**
- List all locations
- Add new location with validation
- Edit existing location
- Delete location (with constraint checking)

✅ **Product Movements**
- List all movements with type indicators
- Add new movement with dropdown selectors
- Edit existing movement
- Delete movement
- Automatic timestamp recording

### 3. Movement Types

✅ **Incoming Stock** (from_location = NULL)
- Items moved INTO a location
- Example: New inventory arrival

✅ **Outgoing Stock** (to_location = NULL)
- Items moved OUT of a location
- Example: Sales, disposal

✅ **Transfer** (both locations specified)
- Items moved BETWEEN locations
- Example: Warehouse to retail store

### 4. Reporting System

✅ **Inventory Balance Report**
- Real-time calculation per product per location
- Formula: Balance = SUM(to_location qty) - SUM(from_location qty)
- Color-coded indicators:
  - Green: Positive stock
  - Red: Negative stock (data errors)
  - Gray: Zero balance
- Only displays non-zero balances

### 5. User Interface

✅ **Bootstrap 5 Responsive Design**
- Clean, modern interface
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Intuitive navigation bar
- Flash message notifications
- Form validation (client & server-side)
- Confirmation dialogs for deletions

✅ **Navigation Menu**
- Home (Dashboard)
- Products
- Locations
- Movements
- Reports

### 6. Sample Data

✅ **Pre-loaded with:**
- 4 Products (Laptop, Mouse, Cable, Monitor)
- 4 Locations (Main Warehouse, Retail Store, Distribution Centers)
- 20 Product Movements (Incoming, Outgoing, Transfers)

### 7. Validation & Error Handling

✅ **Form Validation**
- Required field checking
- Quantity must be positive
- At least one location required
- From/To locations cannot be same
- Flash messages for all operations

✅ **Database Constraints**
- Cannot delete products with movements
- Cannot delete locations with movements
- Foreign key integrity maintained
